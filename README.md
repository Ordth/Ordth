## Introduction

Hi, Ordth here. Welcome to my Github. There's not much yet here but i'm gonna try my best to feed it. Truth is i'm still a newbie so it's probably gonna take some time. Before starting coding i worked here and there, did a bit of translation.

I'm currently working on css, html and javascript (mainly making head of it). I did some python before though: Vigenere encryption, making a tic tac toe, making a snake, that kind of things~~.  
So i don't really have any project worthy of being mentioned yet !

I'm really not much of a presence on any social media, more of a *lurker*.
**BUT** i'm looking forward to getting to know the Github community !
