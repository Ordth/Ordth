## Introduction

<h3 style = "color: lightgreen;"><u> About me</u> :</h3>

Hi, <span style = "color: lightgreen;">Ordth</span> here. Welcome to my Github. There's not much yet here but i'm gonna try my best to feed it. Truth is i'm still a newbie so it's probably gonna take some time. Before starting coding i worked here and there, did a bit of translation.

I'm currently working on css, html and javascript (mainly making head of it). I did some python before though: Vigenere encryption, making a tic tac toe, making a snake, that kind of things~~.  
So i don't really have any project worthy of being mentioned or shown yet !

I'm really not much of a presence on any social media, more of a <span style = "color: lightgreen;">*lurker*</span>.
**BUT** i'm looking forward to getting to know the Github community !

<h3 style = "color: lightgreen;"><u> Hobbies</u> :</h3>

I'll keep it classic if not classy. When i'm not codding, i'm mainly speending my time reading (novels, goold old mangas), playing games (depends of the mood but mostly jrpg. No more multiplayers online games for me, no thank you) and i try my hands at drawing now and then. 

<h3 style = "color: lightgreen;"><u>About the future</u> :</h3>

I'm gonna try to make a living as a developer. Simple as that. Don't know if it's going to work but it makes me want to get up in the morning and that's <span style = "color: lightgreen;">good enough for me</span>  !
